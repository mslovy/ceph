Building

The Accelio XioMessenger is built conditionally only, when --enable-xio is
provided to configure.

Accelio depends on OpenFabrics verbs development headers/libraries.

If either the Accelio or OFED development environments are in non-standard locations,
include and library paths must be added to both CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS, in the Autotools
build as of 1/1/2015.
